Estonian grammar in Grammatical Framework
=========================================

Estonian resource grammar for the Grammatical Framework (GF) Resource Grammar Library (RGL).

__This is work in progress!__

We started out with a fork from the Finnish resource grammar with the general plan to:

  - translate the test lexicon from Finnish to Estonian
  - implement Estonian smart paradigms to replace the Finnish ones
  - tweak the syntax to be Estonian

Status
------

Current status and immediate future plans.

### Nouns

  - 1-arg paradigm: 80% correct
  - 6-arg paradigm: 100% correct (?)
  - no parallel forms
  - TODO: improve 1-arg paradigm
  - TODO: add 2-arg paradigm (nom, gen)

### Adjectives

  - constructed in the same way as nouns
  - comparative guessed: TODO: determine correctness
  - TODO: superlative (not urgent)

### Verbs

  - 1-arg paradigm done
  - TODO: test correctness
  - TODO: püsiühendid

### Lexicon

  - demo lexicon almost translated (TODO: remaining verbs)
  - TODO: derive large lexicon from WordNet

### Syntax

  - some tweaking of the syntax mainly guided by the needs of the MOLTO Phrasebook and ACE-in-GF applications


Testing
-------

To test the noun morphology run (in `tools/`):
