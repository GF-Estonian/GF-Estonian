Estonian grammar in Grammatical Framework
=========================================

Estonian resource grammar for the Grammatical Framework (GF) Resource Grammar Library (RGL).

__This is work in progress!__

We started out with a fork from the Finnish resource grammar with the general plan to:

  - translate the test lexicon from Finnish to Estonian
  - implement Estonian smart paradigms to replace the Finnish ones
  - tweak the syntax to be Estonian

Current state:

  - some experiments with the paradigms
  - some tweaking of the syntax mainly guided by the needs of the MOLTO Phrasebook and ACE-in-GF applications
