* Implemented noun morphology following HJK
   - worst case constructor 6 forms
   - Finnish worst case constructor 10 forms
* Verb morphology
   - Regular internal representation 4 forms
   - Around 30 irregular verbs that need ? forms
   - Finnish worst case constructor 12 forms
   
Other changes
   - Removed question particles from the category of verbs
   - Removed possessive suffix from nouns and dets
   - Removed vowel harmony features
   - Added "oma" possessive to Extra
   - Removed CompPartAP from Extra: copula complement is in nominative    CompPartAP : AP -> Comp ; -- kahvi on valmista
   - To remove from Extra:
    	- Particles (-han, -pa etc.)
    	- Word orders with focused member
   	- PartCN?

TS classification are not always very logical. For instance, 49 is one class which I split in three 1-argument functions: saama~saada ; jooma~juua ; käima~käia. (I could of course just do more matching inside the ``Str -> VForms`` function. Maybe this detail is not so important anyway.)
Classes 50-52 are identical. Stem that you get from ma infinitive doesn't change, you just add suffixes.
Classes 55-57 are identical, just the details of consonant gradation differ. 55 is pp~p, 56 is nd~nn, 57 is lugema~loeb or pidama~peab. 
Class 61 contains both a and e (laulab, kooleb), and you don't know that from ma infinitive.
I merged 62 and 64, because the only difference is that other has consonant gradation and other doesn't. So you can give instruction ``X_weak + "suffix"``, and if X can't be made weaker, it has no effect.

Paradigm from a CS point of view and a linguistic point of view; 
definition of (Aarne & Gregoire smart paradigms paper http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E/E12/E12-1066.pdf); paradigm is a function that you apply to one form to give you n forms, that is, the full inflection table of a lemma. If you consider it as an instruction, 62 and 64 are in the same class: applying the same procedure gives the full inflection table for all words that belong to the TS classes 62 and 64. 
If you consider it as a description, it is more justified to separate the classes. One contains consonant gradation, other doesn't.
Difference between classes 51 and 55-57 is that 51 does not undergo consonant gradation, 55-57 do. They aren't implemented in the same smart paradigm, because verbs 51 could potentially undergo it; that is, applying function ``weaker`` to stems of 51 verbs would transform them and that would result in incorrect forms.

With nouns, we use the HJK (http://kjk.eki.ee/ee/issues/2012/6/156) system, where the full inflection table of a noun can be formed by 6 forms. What is then left to do for the GF smart paradigms is how to form the 6 forms from one.
With verbs the number of forms for forming the full paradigm is 8 -- this is enough for all verbs except _olema_ and _minema_, which are just formed separately. With the assumption that 6 and 8 forms are enough to compute all other forms, we have reduced the immediate problem to finding 6/8 forms based on one.

An example of the template for verbs in TS 63.
The suffixes are fixed; you couldn't produce for instance any verb that has the vowel _e_ in the present tense personal forms, or imperative with the allomorph _ge_.
Second thing is that you can't form a verb whose stem behaves differently. For instance, the verbs _õppima_ and _hüppama_ have different quantities in present tense forms (_õpib_ and _hüppab_), so you can't describe the process that happens in the stem in the same function. 
These are both very intuitive definitions; behaviour and instructions coincide.

  -- TS 63 (andma, murdma, hoidma) 
  cAndma : Str -> VForms = \andma ->
    let
      and = tk 2 andma ;   --murd(ma), hoid(ma)
      an = tk 1 and ;      --mur(d),   hoi(d)
      ann = weaker and ;   --murr,     hoi
    in vForms8
      andma
      (and + "a")
      (ann + "ab")
      (an + "takse")
      (and + "ke")
      (and + "is")
      (and + "nud")
      (an + "tud") ;

Kaarel 5.9.2013

Tested the 1-arg noun paradigm.

  1. Took all nouns from the Estonian WordNet: 65214
  2. Applied Filosoft compound splitting to them
  3. Removed 24262 nouns for which compound splitting failed (Filosoft tag ####)
     TODO: investigate why is this number so large
  4. For the remaining words, removed everything up to the last compound part.
     After sort|uniq, this resulted in 17983 words (non-compounds are also included)
  5. Applied Filosoft morph. generation
  6. Removed words for which generation failed (Filosoft tag ####), resulting in 17551 words
  7. Applied "recode latin1..utf8" which fixed 3 encoding errors that crashed (?) GF (TODO: report this to Filosoft)
     hea, hea, head, heasse, heade, häid
     make-up, make-upi, make-upi, make-upisse|make-upi, make-upide, make-upu|make-upisid
     pea, pea, pead, peasse|pähe, peade, päid
  8. Ran GF's cc on the sg nom forms, something like:

     cat nouns.6forms.csv | sed "s/,.*//" | ./cc.py -r HjkEst.gf --oper "hjk_type" |\
     gf --run | perl -nal -F",\s+" -e 'print "$F[0], $F[1], $F[2], $F[3], $F[15], $F[16]"'

  9. Compared the output against the Filosoft original file using diff-list-set.py,
     resulting in this difference distribution (e.g. 5-6 means that only the plural forms are wrong)

      13853
       1507 2-3-4-5-6
        524 3-5-6
        425 3-4-5-6
        267 2-3-4-5
        251 5-6
        219 2
        186 6
        112 2-4-6
         58 3
         55 2-4-5-6
         50 2-3-5-6
         32 2-4
          9 3-5
          1 4-6
          1 2-3-4-6
          1 2-3-4

So, about 79% of the nouns are currently handled correctly.
