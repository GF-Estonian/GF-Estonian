Talks
=====

The slides of some talks have been written in Markdown.
You can view them directly as plain text with a simple text editor,
or as formatted via GitHub. To convert the slides to HTML, install
[landslide](https://github.com/adamzap/landslide) and run `make` in the
slides' directory. Some of the slides were presented using an [extension of the
default landslide theme](https://github.com/Kaljurand/landslide-themes),
which needs to be installed separately and pointed to in the `Makefile`.
