# Smart paradigm correctness testing script.
# Runs tests for 1,2,3,4 arguments.
#
# Usage examples:
#
# ./test-mk.bash N ../data/nouns.6forms.csv
# ./test-mk.bash N ../data/adj.6forms.csv
# ./test-mk.bash V ../data/verbs.8forms.csv
#
# The script generates 3 files for each number of input arguments:
#
#   - .coverage.txt: frequency distribution of difference types
#   - .diff.txt: 2-column (tab-separated) format that relates the 1st form to the difference type (if any)
#   - .forms.csv: all generated forms (comma-separated)

# Note about rewriting.
# Rewrite the base forms that use the parallel forms notation because
# such |-containing forms are not handled by the opers, so the
# results would be misleading.
# The rewriting preserves just the last parallel form and
# makes the assumption that the correct forms align
# (palk, palga|palgi, palka|palki) but this might not always hold.
